Quite literally just another Wordle clone. A new word is generated every time you visit the page so you can play more than once per day.

## Sources
CSS was built upon the stylesheet from https://github.com/WebDevSimplified/wordle-clone. The dictionary and targetWords jsons were also sourced from here.
